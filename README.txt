# Subregion_radiomics 
This is a matlab demo show how to realise the tumor partitioning and extract radiomics features for PET/CT images.
This matlab code contains 2 demos:


1. ¡°Demo_subregion_partition¡±: matlab codes included local entropy maps of PET/CT images generation, individual-level cluster, subregions generation.


2. "demo_FeaExt":matlab codes to calculate 13 intensity features and 88 textural features for each modality. Except for 57 common texture features, 31 novel texture features were incorporated to fully explore intratumoral heterogeneity.
In addition, the functions of optimal cut-off value determination ('findoptimal'), the stepwise forwords features selection (stepwise_selection) and log-rank test ('logrank') were provided for subsequent survival analysis.
