This sub-regional radiomics package corresponding to a manuscript

Xu et al. Sub-regional radiomics analysis of PET/CT imaging with intra-tumor partitioning: application to prognosis for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Molecular Imaging and Biology, 2019, under review.

1. "Demo_subregion_partition": matlab codes included local entropy maps generation of PET/CT images, individual-level cluster, subregions generation.

2. "demo_FeaExt":matlab codes to calculate 13 intensity features and 88 textural features for each modality. Except for 57 common texture features, 31 novel texture features were incorporated to fully explore intratumoral heterogeneity.

In addition, the functions of optimal cut-off value determination ('findoptimal'), the stepwise forwords features selection (stepwise_selection) and log-rank test ('logrank') were provided for subsequent survival analysis.
